00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
to ride a bike at that point you can
 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.469 align:start position:0%
to ride a bike at that point you can
then<00:04:19.440><c> research</c><00:04:19.680><c> the</c><00:04:19.840><c> next</c><00:04:20.000><c> level</c><00:04:20.239><c> which</c><00:04:20.400><c> is</c>

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
then research the next level which is
 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.710 align:start position:0%
then research the next level which is
like<00:04:20.720><c> okay</c><00:04:20.959><c> cool</c><00:04:21.359><c> what's</c><00:04:21.600><c> a</c><00:04:21.759><c> fancier</c><00:04:22.240><c> bike</c><00:04:22.560><c> and</c>

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
like okay cool what's a fancier bike and

like okay cool what's a fancier bike and
then<00:04:22.960><c> like</c><00:04:23.120><c> how</c><00:04:23.280><c> do</c><00:04:23.360><c> I</c><00:04:23.520><c> aerodynamically</c><00:04:24.240><c> like</c>

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
then like how do I aerodynamically like
 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.310 align:start position:0%
then like how do I aerodynamically like
position<00:04:25.280><c> myself</c><00:04:25.600><c> and</c><00:04:25.759><c> then</c><00:04:25.919><c> how</c><00:04:26.000><c> do</c><00:04:26.080><c> I</c><00:04:26.240><c> get</c>

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 align:start position:0%

00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
I wish more people followed this kind of

I wish more people followed this kind of

sort<00:15:57.440><c> of</c><00:15:57.519><c> stuff.</c><00:15:57.759><c> It's</c><00:15:57.920><c> also</c><00:15:58.079><c> a</c><00:15:58.240><c> lesson</c><00:15:58.399><c> that</c><00:15:58.560><c> I</c>

00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
sort of stuff. It's also a lesson that I
 

00:15:58.639 --> 00:15:59.910 align:start position:0%
sort of stuff. It's also a lesson that I
need<00:15:58.720><c> to</c><00:15:58.800><c> learn</c><00:15:58.959><c> for</c><00:15:59.120><c> myself</c><00:15:59.360><c> because</c><00:15:59.600><c> I</c><00:15:59.759><c> also</c>

00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
need to learn for myself because I also
 

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.350 align:start position:0%
need to learn for myself because I also
have<00:16:00.000><c> a</c><00:16:00.160><c> tendency</c><00:16:00.480><c> to</c><00:16:00.639><c> overthink</c><00:16:00.959><c> and</c><00:16:01.120><c> over</c>

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
have a tendency to overthink and over
 

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.430 align:start position:0%
have a tendency to overthink and over
analyze<00:16:01.759><c> stuff.</c><00:16:02.480><c> Where</c><00:16:02.639><c> is</c><00:16:02.880><c> it?</c><00:16:03.199><c> All</c><00:16:03.199><c> right.</c>

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
analyze stuff. Where is it? All right.
 

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.269 align:start position:0%
analyze stuff. Where is it? All right.
So<00:16:03.680><c> this</c><00:16:03.839><c> is</c><00:16:04.000><c> the</c><00:16:04.240><c> lean</c><00:16:04.560><c> learning</c><00:16:04.880><c> method.</c>

00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
So this is the lean learning method.
 

00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:07.350 align:start position:0%
So this is the lean learning method.

who ever asked me this this sort of

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
stuff is like probably what's holding
 

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.590 align:start position:0%
stuff is like probably what's holding
you<00:16:38.560><c> back</c><00:16:38.720><c> is</c><00:16:38.880><c> that</c><00:16:39.040><c> you're</c><00:16:39.199><c> trying</c><00:16:39.279><c> to</c><00:16:39.440><c> learn</c>

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%

00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
too much stuff. And probably what's
 

00:16:41.279 --> 00:16:42.310 align:start position:0%
too much stuff. And probably what's
holding<00:16:41.440><c> you</c><00:16:41.600><c> back</c><00:16:41.759><c> is</c><00:16:41.920><c> that</c><00:16:42.000><c> you're</c><00:16:42.160><c> not</c>

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
holding you back is that you're not
 

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.829 align:start position:0%
holding you back is that you're not

00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
taking enough action. So, we want to
 

00:16:43.839 --> 00:16:45.509 align:start position:0%
taking enough action. So, we want to
sort<00:16:44.000><c> of</c><00:16:44.079><c> shift</c><00:16:44.320><c> the</c><00:16:44.560><c> equation</c><00:16:44.880><c> from</c><00:16:45.199><c> more</c>

00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
sort of shift the equation from more
 

00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:47.749 align:start position:0%
sort of shift the equation from more
action<00:16:45.839><c> and</c><00:16:46.240><c> less</c><00:16:46.639><c> learning</c><00:16:47.279><c> rather</c><00:16:47.519><c> than</c>

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
more learning and less action, which is
 

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.150 align:start position:0%
more learning and less action, which is

00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
number one. This is the lean learning
 

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.310 align:start position:0%
number one. This is the lean learning
process<00:16:59.279><c> that</c><00:16:59.440><c> he</c><00:16:59.600><c> talks</c><00:16:59.759><c> about</c><00:16:59.839><c> in</c><00:17:00.000><c> the</c><00:17:00.079><c> book.</c>

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
really basic AF, right? Like what's the
 

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.870 align:start position:0%
really basic AF, right? Like what's the
next<00:17:03.759><c> step?</c><00:17:04.000><c> What's</c><00:17:04.160><c> the</c><00:17:04.400><c> information</c><00:17:04.640><c> I</c><00:17:04.799><c> need</c>

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
I'm going to repeat the process. But
 

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.230 align:start position:0%
I'm going to repeat the process. But
